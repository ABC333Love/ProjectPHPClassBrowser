Usage instructions:

PHP cli is required, obviously (php executable must be in your $PATH environment variable)

If you are on ST2 You **must** have a Sublime Text project file saved in the root of the project.
To do this open your Project files (drag and drop the whole directory onto Sublime Text) and then save a new project by using the Project menu item.
This because the ST2 api does not let fetching data from project as ST3 api does.
For ST3 users, project_data() is used, and the file will be saved in the first folder of your project

Then enable the classes scan by adding a setting

"scan_php_classes": true

in your project file.

After saving any file, a new file (containing the classes / method definition will be placed in the project root, named phpclass.sublime-classdb)

In the command palette you will find two new commands: "PHP Class browser: Open Browser" and "PHP Class browser: Close Browser" to open or close the class browser.
Double clicking on a function name or on a classname will open the source file on the definition line.

Suggestions on the autocomplete palette are also available ( note that it's up to you to write working or not code )

In the settings file ( under Package Settings > Project PHP ClassBrowser ) you will find preferences for:

  * "php_executable"        // php executable
  * "class_order"           // default class browser order: can be one of "alpha" or "definition"
  * "enable_completitions"  // enable completitions
  * "two_panels"            // use two panels
  * "one_panel_layout"      // Layout for one panel mode
  * "two_panel_layout"      // Layout for two panels mode
  * "file_extensions"       // Files extensions to scan

If you have many classes / functions and the loading is slow try to use the two_panels mode,
as data is loaded when needed, or try to disable completitions

If you prefer a "vertical" layout i suggest you to set

  "one_panel_layout":{
    "cols": [0.0, 0.75, 1.0],
    "rows": [0.0, 1.0],
    "cells": [[0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 2, 1]]
  },

  "two_panel_layout":{
    "cols": [0.0, 0.75, 1.0],
    "rows": [0.0, 0.5, 1.0],
    "cells": [[0, 0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2, 2]]
  }

in your user configuration
